# About

CycleJet is a framework to create mappings between different categories of jets using CycleGANs.
The model architecture is adapted from https://github.com/eriklindernoren/Keras-GAN/tree/master/cyclegan.

# Install

CycleJet is tested and supported on 64-bit systems running Linux.

Install CycleJet with Python's pip package manager:
```
git clone https://github.com/JetsGames/CycleJet.git
cd CycleJet
pip install .
```
To install the package in a specific location, use
the "--target=PREFIX_PATH" flag.

This process will copy the `cyclejet` program to your environment python path.
